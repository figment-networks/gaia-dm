Gaia instrumentation releases

This repository contains a workflow that builds the Firehose implementation of Gaia with the required binaries. The current Gaia tags are:

- `v4.2.1-fh`
- `v5.0.8-fh`
- `v6.0.0-fh`

## Build steps

When creating a release, include the required tag without the `-fh` suffix and Github Actions will do the rest once the release is complete.
