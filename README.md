Gaia instrumentation releases

This repository contains a workflow that builds the deepmind implementation of Gaia with the required binaries. The current Gaia tags are

- v4.2.1-deepmind
- v5.0.8-deepmind
- v6.0.0-deepmind

## Build steps

When creating a Release, include the required tag without the `-deepmind` and github actions will do the rest once the release is complete
